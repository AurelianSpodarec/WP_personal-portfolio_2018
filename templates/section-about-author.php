		<h2>About Aurelian</h2>
		<h3>HELPING YOU BUILD A SITE THAT WORK FIRST TIME</h3>

		<p class="lead">I’ll start by telling you a bit about my background, so you can get to know why I’m so dedicated to helping people find the right online companies to work with – be it Web Design, SEO or Hosting.</p>
		<p>I was born and raised in London, UK, and I couldn’t be prouder of my hometown. Why? Because this city is incredibly vibrant and full of life. Not only this, but I was always in awe of the many entrepreneurs I met who inspired me to be passionate about starting my own venture one day.
		<br><br>
		I subsequently relocated to Huddersfield with my partner. I quickly fell in love with my adopted home but the fire of entrepreneurial spirit born in the capital stayed with me so I made a decision to establish my own business.
		<br><br>
		That’s exactly what I did – I started my own marketing company. I love being able to help different businesses enter competitive markets and make themselves stand out through their marketing presence.
		<br><br>
		When I was starting up I found it rather difficult to find the right web design company that understood my requirements. I made a few mistakes in my career of working with unprofessional companies that turned out to be untrustworthy and honestly, a waste of my time.
		<br><br>
		Working with many other businesses, I naturally heard a fair share of web design horror stories. From being completely ripped off, to having to end their business due to loss of funding and stress.
		<br><br>
		So not only do I have first-hand experience of working with conning companies, but I have the knowledge of many others too.
		<br><br>
		I wanted to put something in place to prevent this happening to others. This is why Web Design Review was born.</p>
